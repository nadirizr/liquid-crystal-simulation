	As we said in the simulation page, we wanted to explore the changing in phase of liquid crystals undergoing a cooling process. 
	<br> 
	We did this by implementing the Monte Carlo method with the <A href="simulation.html">Gay-Berne potential</A>.

  We simulated 10X10 particles in two dimensions.
	<br>
  We used an effective temperature defined as:
  <center><img src="TStar().jpg" height="10%"/></center>
	Where T is the temperature of the system.
  <br>
  <br>
	Beginning with <img src="TStar.jpg" height="2%"/> = 3.0 and <img src="sigma.jpg" height="2.5%"/> = 0.5, <img src="epsilon0.jpg" height="2.5%"/> = 1.0,
	<img src="kappa.jpg" height="2%"/> = 3.0, <img src="kappa'.jpg" height="2%"/> = 5.0, <img src="meu.jpg" height="2%"/> = 1.0, <img src="neu.jpg" height="2%"/> = 3.0.
	<br> 
  The temperature change at each cooling step was 0.05.
  <br>
  <br>
  The model we used was: <b>2d_large</b>

	We started the cooling process from a random initial state. <br>
	At each step (temperature) we allowed at most 100,000 Metropolis steps and then continued cooling.<br>
	As we can see here in our output we get order out of the initial mess:<br><br>

  We now simulated a 10X10 particle system in two dimensions, with the same system parameters.<br>
  The only changes in the simulation were that the initial temperature used was <img src="TStar.jpg" height="2%"/> = 4.0, and the temperature
  change at each cooling step was 0.01 between <img src="TStar.jpg" height="2%"/> = 1.5 to <img src="TStar.jpg" height="2%"/> = 0.01, so we get
  a slower cooling of the system in those critical temperatures.
	<br>
	With these changes in the cooling process, we will be able to see more changes in phase.

  Most of the analysis was done using the <a href="compare_chart.html">statistics page</a>
  (Explanations for how to use it can be found <a href="manual.html#statistic">here</a>).<br>
  <br>
  First of all, in both simulations the phase changes are visible to some extent.<br>
  In the slow cooling process more phase changes can be seen, and they are more prominent as well.<br>
  The fast quench happens in both cases, and is an indication that even the slow
  cooling isn't slow enough, and solidification occurs at the end.<br>
  <br>
  Secondly, when viewing the Energy vs. Temperature graph for both processes, it
  can be seen that they overlap in most places, and the general trend is the
  same.<br>
  While the faster cooling is more erratic, both systems still follow the same
  path, and both start loosing energy rapidly at almost the same point.<br>
  This can be seen clearly in the graph itself:<br>
  <center><img src="2d_large_vs_slow_cool_temperature.png" height="50%"\></center>
  <br>
  Finally, from viewing the timeline of both systems it can be seen that we
  reach a lower energy at the final temperature in the slower cooling system.<br>
  This implies that, as in real life physics, that with slower cooling and
  carefull equalibiration of the system at each temperature, we can achieve a
  lower total system energy.<br>
  This of course makes sense both physically and in the Monte Carlo simulation
  itself, and can be seen in the following graph:<br>
  <center><img src="2d_large_vs_slow_cool_time.png" height="50%"\></center>
  <br>
  Most phase changes are visible in these two simulations, and the Monte Carlo
  method demonstrates most of the physics involved.<br>
  This is especially evident in the changes noted above between slow and fast
  cooling and their effects on the system.<br>

  Most of the analysis was done using the <a href="compare_chart.html">statistics page</a>
  (Explanations for how to use it can be found <a href="manual.html#statistic">here</a>).<br>
  <br>
  We will discuss several points we arrived at:<br>
  <li>As with the 2D simulations, we witnessed several differences between the fast and slow cooling.</li>
  <li>We also noticed a difference in the slow cooling here, compared to the 2D slow cooling.</li>
  <li>Finally, we will compare as a whole the 2D system to the 3D system.</li>
  <br>
  To the first point, in both 3D simulations the phase changes are visible to some extent.<br>
  As in the 2D simulation, in the slow cooling process more phase changes can be seen,
  and they are again more prominent as well.<br>
  This is good, since it shows consistency in the results of the simulations, and that
  different models behave the same in the same physical conditions.<br>
  The fast quench happens in both cases (as in the 2D variant), and once again shows that
  even the slow cooling isn't slow enough, and solidification occurs at the end.<br>
  <br>
  When we view the Energy vs. Temperature graph for both processes, it
  can be seen that they overlap almost exactly, and the general trend is the
  same (as we have seen in the 2D simulations).<br>
  This again shows consistency in the results, in both 2D and 3D.<br>
  The faster cooling is as expected more erratic, and they both converge in the same area
  of temperatures and start loosing energy rapidly.<br>
  This can be seen clearly in the graph itself:<br>
  <center><img src="3d_small_vs_slow_cool_temperature.png" height="50%"\></center>
  <br>
  When viewing the timeline of both systems it can be seen that we again reach
  a lower energy at the final temperature in the slower cooling system.<br>
  This is very encouragin evidence, as it shows that twice now, in two different
  systems, with slower cooling and carefull equalibiration of the system at each
  temperature, we can achieve a lower total system energy.<br>
  This of course makes sense both physically and in the Monte Carlo simulation
  itself, and can be seen in the following graph:<br>
  <center><img src="3d_small_vs_slow_cool_time.png" height="50%"\></center>
  <br>
  To the second point, the slow cooling in the 3D simulation is decidedly different in several
  aspects from its 2D counterpart.<br>
  For one thing, it is much harder to notice the subtle changes in phase in the 3D model than
  in the 2D model, and not only because of the visual representation.<br>
  In both runs, because we were somewhat limited by computer time and resources (we did not want
  to run a simulation that took weeks), we had to limit the number of Metropolis steps to 10,000.<br>
  This is not a high number, and it would be much better had we used between 40,000 and 60,000
  steps, but that would take much much longer than the few days it took to run our simulations.<br>
  While in the 2D model this was apparently enough to see most of the results, in the 3D model it
  was simply not enough to get very good results.<br>
  A second run of this slow cooling process with more Metropolis steps would allow the system to
  reach a more stable equalibrium at each temperature, and allow for more minute details to show.<br>
  Note that the system is fully capable of running said simulations, and much more intensive runs
  were made on smaller systems.<br>
  <br>
  The final point in the results regards comparing the 2D simulation as a whole to the 3D simulation.<br>
  It is interesting to note that in essence these two systems are not all that different.<br>
  The simulation behaves the same, and while the energy scale is very different, and the temperatures at
  which phase changes occur are somewhat different, the general route both systems take is the same.<br>
  Of course this generalization cannot be made based on the few simulations we ran, but it was mainly
  reasurring to us that the physics stays the same in different system parameters, and the simulation
  system itself is consistent.<br>
