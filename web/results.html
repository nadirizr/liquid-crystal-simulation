	<P>
	As we said in the simulation page, we wanted to explore the changing in phase of liquid crystals under cooling process. 
	<br> 
	We did this by preforming Monte Carlo method with <A href="simulation.html">Gay-Berne potential</A>.

	<P>
	
	We simulated 10X10 particles in two dimensions.
	<br>
	We use <center><img src="TStar().jpg" height="10%"/></center><br>
	where T is the temperature of the system.
	<br>
	Beginning with <img src="TStar.jpg" height="2%"/> = 3 and <img src="sigma.jpg" height="2.5%"/> = 0.5 ,<img src="epsilon0.jpg" height="2.5%"/> = 1 , 
	<img src="kappa.jpg" height="2%"/> = 3  ,   <img src="kappa'.jpg" height="2%"/> = 5  ,  <img src="meu.jpg" height="2%"/> = 1  , <img src="neu.jpg" height="2%"/> = 3.
	<br> 
	<!--If we take an ordered system of spins, and heat it up at once to <img src="TStar.jpg" height="2%"/> = 3, we finally get a mess. <br>
	
	We can see the steps here from our output to AViz:<br><br><br>!-->

	<br>
	<P>
	Now we shall begin our cooling process. <br>
	In each step (temperature) we allow at most 100000 metropolis tries and then continue cooling.<br>
	As we can see here in our output we get an order out of the mess:<br><br>

	We can also see the change of phase in ____.....

	The full statistics with the charts and animations can be found <a href="compare_chart.html">here</a>.
	<br> 
	More explanation of how to use the statistics can be fin in the <a href="manual.html#statistic">manual page</a>.

	<P>
	
	Now we simulates 10X10X10 particles in 3 dimensions.
	<br>
	We use <center><img src="TStar().jpg" height="10%"/></center><br>
	with the same parameters as in 2D except for adding one other dimension with Periodic boundary.<br>
	
	As we can see here in our output we get an order out of the mess:<br><br>
