	<P>
	As we said in the simulation page, we wanted to explore the changing in phase of liquid crystals under cooling process. 
	<br> 
	We did this by preforming Monte Carlo method with <A href="simulation.html">Gay-Berne potential</A>.
	</p>
	<br>
	<P>
	We used _____ particles in __ dimensions.
	<br>
	We use <center><img src="TStar().jpg" height="10%"/></center><br>
	where T is the temperature of the system.
	<br>
	Beginning with <img src="TStar.jpg" height="10%"/> = ___ and <img src="sigma.jpg" height="2.5%"/> = ___ ,<img src="epsilon0.jpg" height="4%"/> = ___ , <img src="kappa.jpg" height="4%"/> = ___ , <img src="kappa'.jpg" height="4%"/> = ____.
	If we take an ordered system of spins, and heat it up at once to <img src="TStar.jpg" height="10%"/> = ___, we finally get a mess. 
	<br>
	We can see the steps here from our output to AViz:<br><br><br>

	<br>
	<P>
	Now we shall begin our cooling process. <br>
	In each step (temperature) we allow at most ___ metropolis tries and then continue cooling.<br>
	As we can see here in our output we get an order out of the mess:<br><br>
	</P>
	<br>
	<P>
	We can also see the change of phase in ____.....
