  <H1><center>About the project</center></H1>
  In this project we modelled a two-dimensions and three-dimensions cooling simulation of Liquid Crystals.
  We used Monte Carlo Simulation with Gay-Berne Potential.
  In this site you can find some educational information about Liquid Crystals, including their famous use in LCDs, as well as how they work, and a summary of what we saw and discovered.

  <b>In this project we investigate the Smectic phase of Liquid Crystals.</b>
