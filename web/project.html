	In this project we modelled a two-dimensions and three-dimensions cooling simulation of Liquid Crystals.
	We used Monte Carlo Simulation with Gay-Berne Potential.
	In this site you can find some educative information about the Liquid Crystal, including their famous use- LCD and how it works, as well as the summery of what we saw and discovered.
