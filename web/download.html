<H2><CENTER>Download the project</CENTER></H2>
There are two ways to download the project:
<ol>
<li>
By <b> svn </b>:
<br>
just go to the place you want to put the files and run in shell- "svn checkout http://liquid-crystal-simulation.googlecode.com/svn/ liquid-crystal-simulation-read-only"
</li>
<br>
<li>
<b>Download directly</b> by 
<a href="">clicking here</a>
</li>
</ol>

<H3><center>How to run the system:</center></H3>
<P>
To run the system you only need to go to the main project library, then write in the shell- "<b>./run.sh MODEL_NAME</b>", <br>
where MODEL_NAME should be the name of the model you use (if you don't write anything it will use the default model).
<br> you can choose- "fixed" , "sphere" , "default" or add another model as explained above in "How to write a configuration file" section.
<br>
you should not write "MODEL_NAME.py"! The system know to take it from models library automatically.
<br>
</P>

<H3><center>How to write a configuration file:</center></H3>
<P>
First of all you should go to the library "models", then you can copy the content of the configuration file "default.py" and name your file as you wish (with the end of .py of course)
<br><br>
Now you only need to change the parameters in your file, so it would be like the system you are willing to get. 
<br><br>
more explanations for some <b>system parameters</b>: <br>
DIMENSIONS = [number of spins in x direction, number of spins in y direction, number of spins in z direction]
<br>
INITIAL_SPACING = [The spacing between spin locations in x direction, The spacing between spin locations in y direction , The spacing between spin locations in z direction]
<br>
INITIAL_SPIN_ORIENTATION = [The initial spin orientation vector in x direction , The initial spin orientation vector in y direction , The initial spin orientation vector in z direction]
<br>
There are more parameters you can change but everything is explained in the file itself as well.
<br>
You can change all the <b>potential parameter</b>- <img src="meu.jpg" height="2%"/>,<img src="neu.jpg" height="2%"/> ,<img src="kappa.jpg" height="2%"/> ,<img src="kappa'.jpg" height="2%"/> ,<img src="epsilon0.jpg" height="2%"/>
<br>
POTENTIAL = name of the potential you want to use, your can choose- "GayBernesPotential" , "LenardJonesPotential" , "FixedNearestNeighboursPotential" , "SphereNearestNeighboursPotential" , or add a new potential as explained below in "How to add new potential section".
<br>
you should only write the name of the potential as in the potential file, with out an ending.
<br> 
<br>
You can also change the <b>Cooling and Heating Algorithms properties</b> such as The standard deviation of the gaussian random spacing in the system.
the standard deviation of the Gaussian random spin orientation, 
the number of Metropolis steps to perform in each step.
the number of steps in the cooling process to wait if there is no improvement before lowering the temperature further, the temperatures to use in the Monte Carlo algorithm,
the path to which to output the AVIZ files.
