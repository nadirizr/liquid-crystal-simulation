<H1><CENTER>Download the Project</CENTER></H1>


<br>
There are two ways to download the project:
<ol>
<li>
By <b>svn</b>:
<br>
<br>
Just go to the place you want to put the files and run the following command in the shell:
<br>
<tt><strong>svn checkout http://liquid-crystal-simulation.googlecode.com/svn/trunk liquid-crystal-simulation-read-only</strong></tt>
<br>
<br>
The project will be in the directory: ./liquid-crystal-simulation-read-only
</li>
<br>
<br>
<li>
<b>Download directly:</b>
<br>
<br>
The project source code: <a href="lc_simulation_src.tar.gz">lc_simulation_src.tar.gz</a>
The project web code and simulations: <a href="lc_simulation_web.tar.gz">lc_simulation_web.tar.gz</a>
<br>
To unpack the source files, put the downloaded file in the directory where you want the project to be, and run the following command in the shell:
<br>
<br>
<tt><strong>tar -xzvf lc_simulation_src.tar.gz</strong></tt>
<br>
<br>
All of the project's sources and run scripts will be in the directory: ./lc_simulation_src
<br>
<br>
The second file contains the web content and the simulation data and statistics that are presented on this website.
To unpack those files, put the downloaded file in the same directory as the previous one, and run the following command in the shell:
<br>
<tt><strong>tar -xzvf lc_simulation_web.tar.gz</strong></tt>
<br>
<br>
All of the projects web content and simulation run data will be added to the directory: ./lc_simulation_src
If you performed this action in the same directory as the previous command, the added directories will be "web" and "runs" within the same project directory.
<br>
<br>

</li>
</ol>
<br>


<H1><CENTER>Download Additional Programs</CENTER></H1>


<br>
The following programs may be needed in addition to the project files:
<ol>
<li>
<a href="http://www.python.org/download/releases/2.4/">python 2.4</a> (and any version above that):
<br>
Needed in case it is not installed - it should be available on any linux system.
</li>
<br>
<br>
<li>
[OPTIONAL] <a href="http://phycomp.technion.ac.il/~aviz/download/download.html">aviz 5.6</a> (and any version above that):
<br>
Needed in order to render and display the model images.
The simulator can still run and generate statistics, graphs of Energy and Temperature, and a timeline, without using AViz.
</li>
<br>
<br>
<li>
[OPTIONAL] <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/swig/files/swig/swig-1.3.39/">swig 1.3</a> (and any version above that):
<br>
Needed if you want to be able to use the fast implementation of the Gay-Bernes potential (implemented in C++).
It is used to wrap the C++ code into Python that can be used by the simulator.
