First let us introduce Lennard-Jones potential, which is a non-bounded site to site potential:
<br>
<br><center><img Src="LJPotential.jpg" height="60"/></center><br>
<br>
Where <img src="sigma.jpg" height="2%"/> is separation of the particles when <img src="Uij=0.jpg" height="3%"/> , also known as the collision diameter. 
<img src="epsilon.jpg" height="2%"/> is the depth of the potential well at the minimum in <img src="Uij.jpg" height="3%"/> .

<P>
Gay - Berne potential is a generalization of  Lennard  - Jones potential for anisotropic particles.
The Gay - Berne potential is a phenomenological model that includes both attractive and repulsive forces. The molecules in the GB system have translational and orientational degrees of freedom.
<br>
The GB potential is given by 
<br><center><img src="GBPotential.jpg" height="37"/></center><br>
Where <img src="sigma.jpg" height="2%"/> is the intermolecular separation at which the attractive and repulsive terms cancel and is given as
<br><br>
<center>
<img src="sigma().jpg" height="9%"/>
</center>
<br>
The shape anisotropy parameter <img src="chi.jpg" height="3%"/> is <br>
<center><img src="chi().jpg" height="7%"/></center>
<br>
Where  <center><img src="kappa().jpg" height="4%"/></center> <br>and <img src="sigma_ee.jpg" height="3%"/> is the separation when the molecules are end to end and 
<img src="sigma_ss.jpg" height="3%"/> that when they are side by side.
<br><br>
The depth of the well is expressed as 
<br><br>
<center><img src="epsilon().jpg" height="4%"/></center>
<br><br>
Where 
<br><br>
<center><img src="epsilonij().jpg" height="5%"/></center>
<br><br>
and 
<br><br>
<center><img src="epsilon'().jpg" height="9%"/></center>
<br><br>
Where the parameter <img src="chi'.jpg" height="3%"/>  is related to the anisotropy in the well depth via 
<br><br>
<center><img src="chi'().jpg" height="9%"/></center>
<br><br>
Where <img src="kappa'().jpg" height="4%"/> is the ratio of well-depth for end to end and side by side.
<br>
<img src="ui.jpg" height="3%"/> and <img src="uj.jpg" height="3.5%"/> are the orientationvectors of the two molecules,
<img src="rij.jpg" height="3%"/> is the vector joining the two centres and <img src="rij_hat.jpg" height="3%"/> is the unit vector.
<img src="epsilon0.jpg" height="3%"/> and <img src="sigma0.jpg" height="3%"/> are scaling parameters.

Monte Carlo methods are a broad class of computational algorithms that rely on repeated random sampling to obtain numerical results; 
i.e., by running simulations many times over in order to calculate those same probabilities heuristically just like actually playing and recording your 
results in a real casino situation: hence the name. They are often used in physical and mathematical problems and are most suited to be applied when it 
is impossible to obtain a closed-form expression or infeasible to apply a deterministic algorithm. 
<br>
<H3>Metropolis step</H3>
<ol>
<li>Select a particle at random. </li>
<li>Attempt a displacement of the selected particle.</li>
<li>Compute the change in potential. </li>
<li>Accept the move with probability <img src="prob().jpg" height="6%"/> 
</ol>

We preformed Monte Carlo method with Gay-Berne potential, to simulate fast heating and then cooling liquid crystal and investigate the phases it is going through.
