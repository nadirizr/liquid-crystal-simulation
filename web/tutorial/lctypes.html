<H1><CENTER>Classification of liquid crystals</CENTER></H1>

<P><FONT SIZE="+3">W</FONT>hen classifying liquid crystal phases we
first of all distinguish between two main types: one with nematic
order and one with smectic order. In the nematic phase (of which the cholesteric
phase is a special case) the molecules are free to move in all
directions (i.e. there is no positional order of the centers of
mass), but on the average they keep their long axes locally parallel
(see <A HREF="states.html#anchor1976436" TARGET="_blank">figure
2</A>). In a smectic state, of which a number of important structural
variations exist (figure 6), we also have a positional order along
one dimension (some smectic phases have positional order in more than
one dimensions). A smectic is a layered structure with the molecules
oriented parallell or tilted relative to the layer normal. Two
smectic phases, called smectic A and smectic C, have acquired a
special importance and are now relatively well understood. They are
characterized by absence of positional order within the layers; the
molecules have some freedom to move within the layers, while they, as
in all smectic phases, are much less free to move between layers.
These smectics can therefore be said to be stacks of two-dimensional
fluids, but they behave as crystalline across the layers. The
abscence of in-layer order contributes to their high potential for
future electro-optic applications.</P>

<P>There are several smectic phases differing from one another in the
tilt angle that the director makes with the layer normal, and also in
the arrangement of molecules within each layer. The smectic phases
that have been reported (eleven phases so far) do not exhaust the
possibilities. The simplest is the smectic A phase (figure 6, left
part) characterized by a director parallel to the layer normal and
random positional order within the plane. Substances featuring the A
phase also often exhibit the smectic C phase (figure 6, right part)
at a lower temperature. In this phase the molecules have the same
random order within the layer but tilt relative to the layer normal.
The tilt angle normally increases with decreasing temperature.</P>

<P>The other smectic phases are even more crystalline in that they
also feature some positional order within the layers. They may for
instance exhibit hexagonal packing of the molecules.</P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+3">S</FONT>o far we have avoided mentioning the
important concept ofchirality.
This is a strictly geometric concept and should therefore not be
confused with something dependent of the different phases of
the liquid crystal. A chiral object has such a shape that it cannot
be superposed on its mirror image. An example is the human hand. Try
putting on a left hand glove (the left hand is the mirror image of
the right) on your right hand, and you'll get a "hands on" experience
of what chirality means!</P>

<P>An object is either chiral or achiral (it either lacks or has
mirror symmetry); it cannot be both. If a liquid crystaline substance
consists of chiral molecules we denote this by putting a star after
the phase labels, for instance N* or C*. Chirality is <I>not</I> a
state of matter and there can thus be no phase transition from chiral
to achiral, or vice versa. For instance, a nematic phase made up of
chiral molecules (this is what we call a cholesteric) cannot turn
into an achiral phase at a certain temperature. Chirality has
important consequences on the macroscopic arrangement of the liquid
crystal molecules and this in turn affects the optical behaviour of
the substance.</P>

<P>The nematic phase of a chiral substance has a name of its own; 
the cholesteric phase. 
This has a historical background. The existence of liquid
crystalline phases was discovered in 1888 by an Austrian botanist
named Friedrich Reinitzer. His first observations were made on
cholesteryl benzoate (thereby the name cholesteric) which is a chiral
mesogen with a cholesteric phase between the solid and liquid states.
The cholesteric phase features a helical arrangement of the molecules, 
as in figure 7a. As you see in the
figure, the helix axis, around which the molecules twist, lies
perpendicular to the local director. Since the twist has a constant
strength throughout the sample, we get a periodic structure along the
helix axis. It is not a positional periodicity but a directional.
Every half turn of the helix the molecules are oriented the same way
(remember that the director has no sign; turning it 180&#176; or
360&#176; gives the same result). If the full helical turn (generally
called the pitch, <I>P</I>, of the cholesteric) is of the same order
of magnitude as the wavelength of visible light, this has spectacular
optical consequences. If we shine light with a wavelength
corresponding to the pitch, through the sample along the helix axis,
the circularly polarized component with the same handedness as the
helix is totally reflected! This gives the substance a beautiful
intense color, easily observable by the naked eye. Since the pitch
varies with temperature, the color of the substance will also vary!
The color will also vary with viewing angle since light entering at
an angle sees a longer optical periodicity. You have most certainly
seen this effect in some liquid crystal thermometer.</P>

<P>When a chiral substance exhibits smectic phases it can also lead
to a defect-free twisted macroscopic structure. However, due to the
layered structure, no twist can be admitted within the layer. Without
breaking the layers, the orientation of the director can vary
continuously only between the layers, thus when going from one layer
to the next. Hence, the helix axis must now lie perpendicular to the
layer planes. (In highly chiral substances, a frustrated phase called
the Twist Grain Boundary (TGB) phase, where the helix axis is
parallel to the layers, may be found - see below!) In the untilted A*
phase this leads to no visible difference compared to the achiral A
phase. However, the chirality of A* gives it new physical properties,
different from those of the A phase. But when the director starts to
tilt, as in the C* phase, we do get a helicoidal macroscopic
structure, namely in that the azimuthal
angle of the director changes with a constant value from layer to
layer. This gives the structure of figure 7b. Normally it takes some
hundred layers to complete one revolution in the azimuthal angle.</P>

<P>In some cases, when the intrinsic twisting power of the material
is very high, the continuous layer structure of the smectic A* may
break down, permitting a twist with twist axis perpendicular to the
director, as in a cholesteric. This means that the smectic structure
breaks down into periodic stacks of layers, with a finite twist in
between, mediated by a regular array of screw dislocations. This kind
of defect structure is called TGB (Twist-Grain-Boundary) phase and is
the smectic correspondence to Blue Phase which may appear out of a
cholesteric as a result of a very high twisting power. A
corresponding TGB phase can also form from a smectic C* phase. In
both cases the twist axis is along the smectic layers. The TGB phases
exist only in a very narrow temperature range.</P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+3">T</FONT>he liquid crystals described on these
pages are all of the so called thermotropic type. The name
reflects the fact that they change phase depending on the
temperature. However, liquid crystals may also be
lyotropic. Such liquid crystals, although sharing some basic
features with the thermotropic liquid crystals, normally differ
widely from these, both in structure, properties and applications (in
many cases, however, the liquid crystal must be considered to belong
to both classes). Their organization is normally not based on
mesogenic properties of a certain molecule but rather on the
<I>interaction</I> between two, or even more, molecular units in
solution. Therefore their sequence of phases rather depends on the
concentration of the different components added to the mixture than
on temperature. These types of liquid crystal are very common in the
biological world, for instance in cell membranes where we find both thermotropic and lyotropic forms of liquid
crystals.</P>

<P>Liquid crystal molecules may also be chemically tied together by
polymerization. Liquid crystal polymers is a relatively young, but very promising, 
branch of liquid crystal research. 
The combination of the features of liquid crystals with
those of polymers might lead to such applications as for instance
flexible displays, non-linear optics devices and sensors with special
, e.g. piezoelectric, properties.</P>
