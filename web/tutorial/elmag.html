<H1><CENTER>Liquid crystals in an electric field</CENTER></H1>

<P>The main application area of liquid crystals is in electro-optic
devices. These are electrically controlled devices that modulate
light in a desired way. We have already given a short description of
the optical properties of liquid crystals, and to conclude this short
tutorial we will now give a brief description of how liquid crystal
molecules respond to electric fields.</P>

<P>Molecules, as opposed to ions, are neutral entities. This means
they have no surplus electric charge. However, the charge
distribution at different parts of the molecule may very well vary.
If one end of the molecule has a slight surplus of positive charge,
and the other a negative charge surplus, the molecule becomes a dipole.</P>

<P>Almost all liquid crystal molecules are dipoles, although the
charge distribution normally is much more complicated than just
described. A dipole in an electric field wants to turn such that the
positive end points along the field and the negative one in the
opposite direction. Therefore, one could be tempted to believe that
this is the mechanism behind the electro-optic effects observed in
liquid crystals. However, except in the very special cases of polar
liquid crystals, which were introduced around 1975 by Robert B. Meyer
and which since then are a very important field of liquid crystal
research (see next page), this is not at all the case. In the
majority of cases, in nematic and cholesteric materials, and in most
smectic materials, the short range molecular organization is such
that the local dipoles are everywhere compensating each other on the
average, and this tendency to anti-parallel order is so strong that
it is not at all affected by external electric fields. In other
words, there is a "head-and-tail" symmetry in the distribution of the
rodlike molecules. There are always as many molecules "head up" as
"head down". The nematic liquid crystal therefore has
<I>quadrupolar</I> order and not dipolar (polar) order, which is also
the reason why we can change sign on the local director (<B>n</B>
-&gt; -<B>n</B>) without changing any macroscopic properties of the
material.</P>

<P>The mechanism behind the fact that the local optic axis is
affected by an external electric field is instead based on the
anisotropic< properties of the nematic; in this case the
important point is that the dielectric
constant is different in the direction along the director from
the one in the direction perpendicular to it. Most often the
dielectric constant is larger along <B>n</B>, and because the
director turns in such a way that the maximum value of the dielectric
constant lies along the direction of the field, the director, and
hence the optic
axis, orients along the field for such molecules.</P>

<P>In a solid the dipoles are too tightly bound to be easily
reoriented by an electric field. In a normal liquid the thermal
motion of the molecules normally overcomes the tendency for the
dipoles to orient. In a `polar liquid crystal, on the other
hand, we find just the right combination of order and flexibility to
make the dipoles follow the sign of the field. Because the dipoles
have a fixed sterical relation to the director, the field will turn
the optic axis. This can be used to control the way the optic axis
points, or to unwind the helical structure of a chiral tilted smectic
phase. Polar liquid crystals is the topic of the next chapter...</P>
