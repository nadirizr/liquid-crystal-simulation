<H1><CENTER>The wave nature of light</CENTER></H1>

<P><FONT SIZE="+3">L</FONT>ight has, as you might know, a dualistic
nature; it can be treated as a stream of particles (photons) or as a
wave motion. When we deal with the optical effects of liquid crystals
we sometimes use the first approach to treat light scattering, but
normally the latter is used to treat the large number of interesting
and often unique optical phenomena. The light wave is a transverse
electromagnetic wave motion. This means that it consists of two
coupled, electric and magnetic, fields oscillating in a plane
perpendicular to the beam direction (see figure 3). To simplify
things, however, we often use only the electric field vector
(E-field) when describing light.</P>

         <ADDRESS>Figure 3. A light wave is a transverse
         electromagnetic wave, that is it is a combination of an
         oscillating electric field and an oscillating magnetic
         field. The fields oscillate perpendicular to each other and
         both fields oscillate in a plane perpendicular to the
         propagation direction.</ADDRESS>

<P>If we study a fix point in space passed by a light beam and let
time pass, the electric field vector will describe a more or less
complex or chaotic motion in the oscillation plane. It may for
instance oscillate along a line (figure 4a) or it may rotate in the
plane (figure 4b). The manner in which the light oscillates is
described as its state of polarization. The E-field vector of
linearly polarized light describes a motion like in figure 4a (upper
part), while figure 4b (upper part) describes circularly polarized
light. Both are special cases of the general case, eliptically
polarized light. In general the motion may be understood as a
superposition of two perpendicular linearly polarized components (or
two circularly polarized components with opposite handedness) with a
well defined phase relationship, as described in the figure. Most light is, however,
more or less unpolarized, which means that only to some degree there
is a constant phase relation between the two components; in the
completely unpolarized state there is a random motion of the electric
field vector in the transverse plane.</P>
