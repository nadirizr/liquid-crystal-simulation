<P><FONT SIZE="+3">T</FONT>he anisotropy of mesogenic molecules, along with the
high degree of orientational order in the liquid crystal phases,
leads to several interesting optical phenomena. 
Light passing through a liquid crystal sample will experience different 
refractive indices depending on the polarization direction 
relative to the local director orientation. This means that the component polarized
parallell to the director will traverse the medium with a different
speed from that of the perpendicularly polarized component. This
affects the phase relationship between the components and leads to a change in
polarization state. For instance, if the incident beam is linearly
polarized the polarization direction is generally changed on passage
through the sample, and the light may in addition become eliptically
polarized (see figure 5).</P>

<P>When looking at liquid crystals in a microscope you often insert
the sample between crossed polarizers.
The first (often referred to as the polarizer) secures that
the incident light is linearly polarized in one specific direction.
Since the polarizers are crossed, no light would emerge through the
second polarizer if the liquid crystal were absent. But when the
light passes through the anisotropic sample its polarization state is
altered and thus some of it may pass through the second polarizer
(often referred to as the analyzer). The sample now often
appears in bright colors, since the effect is wavelength dependent
(the phase difference between the two components after passage of the
sample is a function of the wavelength of the light).</P>
