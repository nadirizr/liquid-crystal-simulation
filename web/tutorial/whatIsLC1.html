<H1><CENTER>What Are Liquid Crystals?</CENTER></H1>

<P>Most substances exist in three phases:
solid (often crystalline), liquid and vapour. The difference between these states of matter is
the degree of order in the material, which is directly related to the
surrounding temperature and pressure. At low temperatures, when the
material is in its solid state, the constituents (atoms, ions or
molecules) cannot move about freely. Their only movements are thermal
vibrations about an equilibrium position (see the left image below).</P>

<P>If the temperature is raised, more energy is put into the system,
leading to stronger and stronger vibrations. Finally, at the
transition temperature between the solid and liquid states, the long
range positional order is broken and the constituents may move about
in a random fashion (center image), constantly bumping into one another
and abruptly changing direction of motion. The thermal energy is
still not, however, high enough to completely overcome the attractive
forces between the constituents, so there is still some positional
order at short range. Because of the remaining cohesion,
the density of the liquid is constant even though, as opposed to the solid, the
liquid takes the shape of its container. If we keep on raising the
temperature until the next phase change, the substance enters its gas
(or vapour) state and its constituents are no longer bound to each
other (right image).</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>Certain organic substances possess more
condensed phases than the basic two. They are referred to as liquid
crystals and their constituent molecules are often called <i>mesogens</i>.
Their different extra phases, found between the solid and liquid
states, are called <i>liquid crystalline phases</i> or sometimes <i>mesophases</i>.
Liquid crystal molecules are always shape anisotropic,
normally having a more or less rodlike shape.</P>

<P>Because of the anisotropic shape of the liquid crystal molecules we must 
consider the orientational order in the material. The liquid
crystalline phases all exhibit high orientational order while the
order in molecule positions is limited.<!-- An example is shown in figure
2. The positional arrangement in the liquid crystalline phases varies
from complete disorder to order in one dimension (the molecules tend
to form layers) or slightly more. A substance in a liquid crystalline
phase is therefore a fluid in that it assumes the shape of its
container. At the same time the high orientational order gives this
fluid higly anisotropic properties, which distinguishes it from normal liquids which are
always isotropic (the liquid phase of a mesogenic compound is therefore normally
denoted the isotropic phase)!-->.</P>

<P>The orientational order in the liquid crystal phases is of course
not perfect, if we will take a snapshot of a liquid
crystalline sample we will find quite large differences in
orientation of different molecules .<!--(see figure 2) There is, however,
locally a distinct preferred direction around which the
molecules fluctuate.!--> The average molecule orientation is described
by a unit vector called the director,
denoted by n. <BR>
