<P><FONT SIZE="+3">A</FONT>lso in polar liquid crystals, the
direction given by <B>n</B> describes quadrupolar order, i.e. the
physics is invariant under the inversion <B>n</B> -&gt; -<B>n</B>.
The first such phase to be investigated was chiral smectic C, or C*
for short. If we look at the local structure of this phase (figure 8)
we see that its monoclinic symmetry has a two-fold rotation axis (C<FONT SIZE="-2">2</FONT>)
going out of the plane of the screen. A polarization vector may go
out of or into this plane and is in either case unchanged under the
two-fold rotation. If the C phase is chiral the plane cannot be a
mirror plane and therefore the polarization cannot be cancelled by
the reflection symmetry as it would in the case of a non-chiral
smectic C. The symmetry of the C* phase thus permits a polarization
which is perpendicular to the tilt plane (and perpendicular to the
director <B>n</B>).</P>

<P>If all molecules in all layers would tilt in the same direction we
would therefore have a <I>macroscopic</I> polarization perpendicular
to the tilt plane. However this is not the case. Foremost due to the
chirality, the tilt direction precesses in a helical fashion in space
as we move along the layer normal
from layer to layer (figure 9).</P>

         <ADDRESS>Figure 9. The helical configuration of the
         director-polarization couple is characteristic of a bulk
         smectic C*. The helix is wound up by a sufficiently strong
         electric field E. The increasing field induces a macroscopic
         polarization (which is thus not spontaneous) and finally
         polarizes the medium to saturation (all dipolar
         contributions lined up parallel to the field).</ADDRESS>
      </TD>
   </TR>
</TABLE>
</P>

<P>Such a structure is called helielectric or more precisely
helical antiferroelectric, because the helix cancels the
macroscopic polarization to zero. The helix can be unwound by
applying a sufficiently strong electric field perpendicular to the
helix axis until all dipoles have been turned into the field
direction. It can, however, also be suppressed by surfaces, in a
special so-called bookshelf geometry (smectic layers perpendicular to
the surfaces), when these come sufficiently close together, typically
one or two micrometers. In this case <I>spontaneous</I> domains of UP
and DOWN polarization appear (figure 10) and the material between the
surfaces acquire ferroelectric properties (Clark and Lagerwall,
1980). Such a structure is therefore called a
<I>Surface-Stabilized</I> Ferroelectric Liquid Crystal (SSFLC).</P>

<P>The attribute <I>ferroelectric</I> means that its response to an
external electric field of an SSFLC is not any longer linear around
the origin (as in the helielectric or antiferroelectric case) but
strongly <I>non-linear</I>, with a certain <I>field threshold</I>
(figure 11). This means that the structure is <I>bistable</I> and can
take one of two different states of opposite polarization in the
absence of any external field. In other words, it has memory
properties. Moreover, the switching from one state to the other on
reversing the sign of the field, is now extremely fast, obeying the
simple equation</P>

<P>where <I>tau</I> is a characteristic switching time, <I>gamma</I>
a characteristic viscosity, <B>P</B> the polarization and <B>E</B>
the electric field. The switching time is found to be in the lower
microsecond range. The surface-stabilized ferroelectric liquid
crystals and their device physics are currently a domain of intense
international research.</P>

<P>"Ferroelectric" also means that there exists a macroscopic
polarization in the absence of an external electric field, which is
switchable between two stable states. (If the macroscopic
polarization is not switchable the state is called
<I>pyroelectric</I>.) It may be noted that no ferroelectricity has
been found to exist so far in the bulk of any liquid crystalline
phase. Thus the smectic C* phase is not ferroelectric per se. Surface
stabilization is required for the appearance of macroscopic
polarization and discrete stable states.<BR>

         field; from top to bottom: paraelectric, ferroelectric,

         antiferroelectric). A ferroelectric phase shows the
         peculiarity of two stable states. These states are polarized
         in opposite directons (&#177;P) in absence of applied field
         (E=0). The property in a material to have two stable states
         is called bistability.</ADDRESS>
